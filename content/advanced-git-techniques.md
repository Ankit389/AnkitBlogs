### introduction 
GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration that allows you to manage and store your code repositories. It’s built on top of Git, a distributed version control system. GitHub provides features like issue tracking, project management, and collaboration tools. Here’s a comprehensive guide to GitHub documentation, including key concepts, common commands, and best practices.


### Key Concepts

Repositories

A repository (repo) is a storage space where your project files and their revision history are kept.

Create a Repository:
On GitHub, navigate to the "Repositories" tab on your profile or organization page and click "New".

Name your repository, add a description, and choose whether it should be public or priv

### Commits
Commits are snapshots of your changes.

 Each commit has a unique ID and message describing what was changed.


 ### Making a Commit

 ```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
 git add <file>   # Stage changes
git commit -m "Commit message"  # Commit with a message
```

### Branches

Branches allow you to work on different versions of your project 

simultaneously. The main branch is typically called main or master.



Create a Branch:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git branch <branch-name>

```

Switch Branches

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git checkout <branch-name>

```



Merge Branches:
 
### Pull Requests (PRs)

Pull Requests are a way to propose changes and review them before merging them into the main branch.

Creating a Pull Request:


Push your branch to GitHub.

Go to your repository on GitHub and click "Pull Requests" > "New Pull Request".

Select the branch you want to merge and create a pull request.


###  Issues
ssues are used to track bugs, tasks, and feature requests. They provide a way to discuss and manage work.

Create an Issue:

Go to the "Issues" tab in your repository and click "New Issue".

Fill in the title, description, and any relevant labels.


### Forking and Cloning

Forking: Create a copy of a repository under your account to make changes independently.

Click "Fork" on the repository page to create a fork.


Cloning: Download a copy of the repository to your local machine.

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) 

feature that allows you to automate workflows.

Example Workflow: .github/workflows/ci.yml

name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test


  ### GitHub Pages


GitHub Pages allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repository.

Setup:
Create a branch named gh-pages or use the main branch.

Add your static site files (HTML, CSS, JS).

Go to the repository settings, find the "Pages" section, and configure the source branch.



### Common Git Commands


Clone a Repository:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git clone <repository-url>
```

Check Repository Status:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git clone <repository-url>


```
Check Repository Status:
```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/ 
git status
```

Stage Changes:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git add <file>
```

Commit Changes:
```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git commit -m "Commit message"
```
Push Changes:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/

git push origin <branch-name>
```

Pull Changes:
```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/ 
git pull origin <branch-name>
```


Branching and Merging

List Branches:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/
git branch
```

Delete a Branch:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/ 
git branch -d <branch-name>

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/ 


Rebase Branch:

```c showLineNumbers {1-3} /printf/ 
git rebase <base-branch>
```
### Best Practices


Write Clear Commit Messages: Make sure your commit messages are descriptive and explain the purpose of the changes.

Use Branches for Features: Create separate branches for new features, fixes, or experiments.

Review Pull Requests: Before merging, review pull requests to ensure code quality and consistency.

Regularly Pull Changes: Keep your local repository up-to-date with the remote repository to avoid conflicts.

Document Your Project: Use README.md files to document your project, 

including setup instructions, usage, and contribution guidelines.
